# Smart Definition

Smart Definition is a Neovim plugin that does only one thing: it jumps to the file with the definition already opened in another window if it is open.

## Features

- On `gd` jump to already opened window if exists, if not, works as usual.

## Installation

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'erslee/smart-definition.nvim'
```
